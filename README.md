# Recipes

This is my first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com), it's a way to put in practice what i've learned so far.

This is a simple website that index (*delicious*) recipe pages. Here i'll demonstrate my currently *html*, *git*, *commit writting* and some others skills.
